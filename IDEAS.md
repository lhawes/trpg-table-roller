Ideas for the trpg table generator:
Style:   Add different styling options to match classic tables published in dnd books
Feature: Conditionally roll on table based on result
Feature: Change file structure to be easy to edit (not JSON)
Feature: Swap between giant text interpreter or table mode
Feature: Some way to share tables between people
Feature: Easy print out the tables that you create
Fix:     Remove all create react app stuff
Fix:     Auto focus new table entry
Request: Selectively reroll a result
Request: Add weighted entry mechanic
Request: Output as csv
Request: Allow for multiple rolls of the same table in the same entry (roll 2 etc)
